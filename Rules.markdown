# Meetup Rules

Everyone is welcome to our meetups. We strive to create a welcoming atmosphere, therefore we created a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/RubyAndFriends/code_of_conduct). It's **tl;dr** is: _"Be nice to others"_. But if you want to be a speaker, you should read it in full (it's short).

## Drinking

We usually have water, soft-drinks and beers available (thanks to our sponsors!) and the majority of attendees tend to drink one or two cans of beer. While in cases some people got a bit tipsy, this is neither generally the case nor what we want to a see. So far we never witnessed any inappropriate behavior and hope it stays this way, so that we do not have to set up stricter rules around alcohol consumption.

## HR, Recruiters, Startup founders & Co

They are welcome to join our meetups, listen to talks, to meet with people, discuss things.

*What we do not want to see is:*

* sales pitches on stage
* 'we are hiring' pitches on stage (the speakers and the host are welcome to mention this and to talk briefly about their company)
* recruiting during our event

Normal participation, bringing stickers or other swag and networking is all fine and welcome.
